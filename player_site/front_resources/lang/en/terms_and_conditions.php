<p>The “Operator” operates a gaming platform at {{@site.domains.desktop}} (the "Gaming Platform") that is accessed by end users (the "Player"). The Player uses the Gaming Platform for data settlement and visual gaming purposes, and an intermediary (the "Intermediary") for all payment issues relating to their use of the Gaming Platform (the "Payment Service"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Payment Service is subject to a contract between the Player and the Intermediary to which the Operator is not party and therefore the Payment Service is not covered by these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions govern the Player's use of the Gaming Platform and their relationship with the Operator. The Player should read these terms and conditions carefully as they affect their rights and liabilities under the law. If the Player does not agree with these terms and conditions, they should not use the Gaming Platform. If the Player has any questions about these terms and conditions, they should contact <a href="mailto:<?php echo Config::get('settings.EMAIL_SENDER') ; ?>"><?php echo Config::get('settings.EMAIL_SENDER') ; ?></a>.</p>

The Player should ensure that any details provided by them in order to establish an Account (i.e. the details provided to the Intermediary) or at any time thereafter are correct and complete and must inform the respective Intermediary immediately of any changes to their details by updating their Account in order that any communication or notice issued by the Operator can be communicated to them effectively.
